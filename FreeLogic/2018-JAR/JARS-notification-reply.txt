Not really : Setting the solver to CVC4 means that the proof are accepted without replaying them, effectively bypassing the Isabelle kernel. This means that you are currently trusting the translation and the SMT solver CVC4. The smt method when used with z3 does not have this issue, as Isabelle is able to replay the proofs. Remark that since Isabelle2018, 'smt_oracle' must be explicitly written in the theory.
I am fine with trusting SMT solvers, as long as it is acknowledged in the paper.
If this point is addressed, I am fine with accepting the paper.

=========
Thank you. We have now rewritten the text on page 15/16 as follows; this should hopefully solve the issue.

  In our experiments we have also made use of the Isabelle/HOL's
  \textsc{smt} method, which ``translates the conjecture and any
  user-supplied facts to the SMT solvers’ many-sorted first-order
  logic, invokes a solver, and (depending on the solver) either trusts
  the result or attempts to reconstruct the proof in Isabelle.''
  \cite[p.~5]{Sledgehammer}.\footnote{Technical remark: We have
    selected CVC4 in our experiments as the default SMT solver, since
    we did run into errors when working with Z3. These errors can
    easily be reconstructed in the provided source files when
    switching back to Z3 as default.}  For quite some time the use of
  the \textsc{smt} method has been controversially discussed in the
  Isabelle/HOL community, and there is in fact a significant difference
  between using the \textsc{smt} method in combination with Z3 or with
  CVC4, as we prefer. When setting the solver to CVC4, the contributed
  proofs are accepted and being trusted without replaying them in the
  Isabelle kernel. Proofs contributed by Z3, in contrast, are never
  trusted and always replayed in Isabelle's kernel. For the work
  presented here this community internal discussion is of minor
  relevance, so that we decided to continue working with CVC4 in order
  to keep our formalisation very concise and also because CVC4
  performed surprisingly well in our experiments.\footnote{An expert
    reviewer of this article, to whom we are very grateful, provided
    alternative proofs which can be
    fully replayed in the kernel of Isabelle.}

See the latter footnote, and also the mentioning of the reviewers in the extended acknowledgement. The mentioning of the funding projects has moved now to the front page.


Some additional typos:
Def 2: D × . . . × D ~> \dotsb
Section 4: " (cf. Fig.2)." add space "Fig. 2"
Section 4.2: Table~1 to avoid the odd line break between the table and the number Section 4.4: "in Isabelle." ( [15, p. 5]).10 For quite some time": extra space
Sect 5. "we show, that their axiom set": no comma needed

Response: 
=========
These typos have all been addressed.
