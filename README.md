# Principia Metaphysica
========================================

This repository contains computer-assisted formalizations of Ed
Zalta's Principia Metaphysica, which is based on Zalta's Theory of
Abstract Objects. This work is based on Second-Order Modal Logic that uses a
Relational Type Theory as a foundation.

The formalization is carried out in Classical Higher-Order Logic (HOL)
employing Benzmüller approach to embed Non-Classical Logics in
HOL. This enables the use of the following proof assistants, theorem
provers and model finders:

* [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/)
* [LEO-II](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/cbenzmueller/leo/) and 
* [Satallax](https://mathgate.info/cebrown/satallax/)).
* [Nitpick](http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/nitpick.html)

Main Challenges
-----------------------

* Bridging between the relational foundation of Zalta's Theory of
Abstract Objects and the functional foundation of HOL

* Controlling comprehension; full comprehension (as given in HOL) is too strong

* Combining static evaluation of certain language constructs (e.g. Actuality and
  Definite Description) wrt to a fixed current world with a dynamic
  evaluation of the other language constructs wrt to possible world
  under consideration
